# Git and GitHub Intro Lab

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Let's apply what we've learned from class to share and update each other's code.  With a partner, you're going going to alternate between who 'drives' and who 'navigates' while following the requirements under "Exercise" below. The goal will be to create a text file containing a message, have a partner fork, clone, and add their own changes, submit the changes as a pull request, and then have the changes merged.  

Be sure to look at the previous lesson for notes and helpful hints.

## Exercise

Partners will be referred to as partner1 and partner2.

### Part 1

**With partner1 driving:**

- create a folder called `git-and-github-practice`
- within that folder create a new text file
- in that file, write a message to your partner.
- initiate a git repository, commit your changes, and push to GitHub


**With partner2 driving, from their computer:**

- get your partners link to the GitHub repository and fork and clone it
- edit the file to add a new message back to your partner
- commit your changes and submit a pull request back to partner1


**With partner1 driving:**

- merge the pull request from the GitHub interface



### Part 2

**With partner2 driving**:


- create a folder called `git-and-github-practice-two`
- within that folder create a new text file
- copy and paste the code from the messages from the first part, and add an additional message for your partner.
- initiate a git repository, commit your changes, and push to GitHub

**With partner1 driving:**

- get your partner's link to the new GitHub repository - fork and clone it
- open the text file, and add a message for your partner.
- commit your changes and submit a pull request back to partner2


**With partner2 driving:**

- merge the pull request from the GitHub interface

**Bonus**:

- use the [syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) documentation to update partner2's local version of `git-and-github-practice` after partner 1 makes additional changes.


#### Deliverable

Each student should add a text file called "my_repo.txt" that contains a link to the new repo on their own Github account.
